This is EGORIDI's blog. Here I will show off a little, 'unfolding a plethora of amazing projects' =/, or simply sharing some simple code with you, whenever I find it beautiful.

You may or may not see themes related to engineering, finance, data-science as well as coding, naturally.

Be kind and be gentle and you will always be welcome. And remember to have fun.

Kind regards,

EGORIDI
